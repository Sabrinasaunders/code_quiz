## Introduction

A study in creating a timed multiple choice quiz on the subject of coding.

## Problem

I had to create new code for HTML, CSS and Javascript to creat the timed quiz. The biggest issue I came across was that my site wasn't working properly at first, the style wasn't showing and the buttons weren't working.

## Solution

I rectified the above problems in the following way:

- I linked the three files together in the correct way.
- Corrected any typos that I had.

See below for a screenshot of the project.
